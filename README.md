# XAI for Lymphoma Diaganosis
## Problem Statement
In critical medical classification tasks, the predictions produced by machine learning models cannot be accepted without scrutiny, as models may rely on false correlations or irrelevant contextual features rather than clinically meaningful patterns. For this reason, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are essential to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of medical image classification systems.

## Soltuion Overview
This project  presents the implementation of an image classification model for malignant lymphoma detection using a medical imaging dataset. Multiple neural network architectures are evaluated, and the Grad-CAM++ technique is applied to visualize the regions influencing the model’s predictions to assess whether classification decisions are driven by tumor-related features or surrounding artifacts.
